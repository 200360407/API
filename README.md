In this part2 of my assignment is to create a .NET Core Web API.

I made two controllers children and companies which with proper Create-Read-Update-Delete functionality for my 
child and company tables which I created in database.

My controllers children will give me "color2
, location and description" of child table.

My companies controller will provide me "Id, name and color" from company table.
